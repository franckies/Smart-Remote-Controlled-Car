# Smart-Remote-Controlled-Car
Implementation of a smart control mechanism for a physical remote-controlled car through a web application.
The car is equipped with an ultrasonic sensor to detect possible obstacles in front of it, three infrared sensors to enable an auto drive option that allows the car to automatically follow a black line depicted on the floor and the Raspberry PI3 single board computer that powers the sensors and hosts a web server on which the web application is running.
The web application allows to start and stop the motors of the car (a traction DC motor and a servo motor for turning the wheels), enable the auto-drive option and manually control the speed and steering of the car.
